// Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

// Use conditionals to return the proper message:

// case	return
// name equals owner	'Hello boss'
// otherwise	'Hello guest'

function greet(name, owner) {
  return name === owner ? 'Hello boss' : 'Hello guest';
}

// Debugging sayHello function
// The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

// Example output:

// Hello, Mr. Spock
function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

function greet1(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
}
